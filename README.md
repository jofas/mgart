# mgart

Machine Generated Art. `mgart` (pronounced "em-gart") is a rust crate and
CLI application for generating art from a set of input parameters.
Rather than you having to create your artwork by hand in a complex
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, you let algorithms draw
your images for you.
While currently far, far away, the goal for `mgart` is to develop an 
easy-to-use yet powerful declarative DSL you can use to create
beautiful images in WYSIWYW (What You See Is What You Want) fashion.
